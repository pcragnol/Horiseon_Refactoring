# Horiseon_Refactoring

## Description

In this project, I refactored HTML and CSS code for the homepage of a fictional marketing agency. My main objective in refining the code was to implement semantic HTML elements to provide structure and improve accessibilty. Along the vein of accessbility, I included alt attributes for all images, also optimizing search engine visibility. As I added semantic elements, I found opportunities to consolidate redundant class attributes to allow for more concise CSS. I subsequently reordered CSS selectors to better match the order of the HTML. Lastly, I added a title to the page and made sure that all internal links functioned properly.

At the end of this project, I learned that even though a website make appear polished, there may still be many improvements to be made beneath the surface. As web developers, it is our duty to write descriptive, concise, and effective code that it is optimized to reach as many users as possible.
